# Example: Research to Architecture Phase Transition

## 🎯 Scenario: Building a GitHub Workflow Automation System

This example demonstrates how to use the phase templates for transitioning from Research to Architecture, showing exactly what inputs the Architecture phase needs from Research.

## 📊 Phase 1: Research & Discovery (COMPLETED)

### ✅ Completed Research Deliverables

#### 1. **Research Findings Document**
```markdown
## GitHub Workflow Automation Research Summary

### Key Findings:
1. **Current Pain Points**
   - Manual PR reviews taking 2-4 hours per day
   - Inconsistent code quality checks
   - Delayed feedback loops (average 6 hours)
   - Missing automation for common tasks

2. **Available Solutions Analysis**
   - GitHub Actions: Native, well-integrated
   - Jenkins: Powerful but complex setup
   - CircleCI: Good but additional cost
   - Custom webhooks: Maximum flexibility

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - GitHub Actions: 2-5 min average runtime
   - Webhook processing: <1 second response
   - API rate limits: 5000 requests/hour
```

#### 2. **Technology Recommendations**
```markdown
## Recommended Technology Stack

### Core Technologies:
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 LTS (proven GitHub API support)
- **Framework**: Express.js (lightweight, well-documented)
- **Queue**: Bull/Redis (reliable job processing)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (complex queries, JSONB support)

### Integration Stack:
- **GitHub API**: Octokit (official SDK)
- **Webhooks**: Probot framework consideration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Winston + ELK stack

### Rationale:
- All technologies have strong GitHub integration
- Community support and documentation
- Proven scalability patterns
- Security best practices available
```

#### 3. **Risk Assessment Matrix**
```markdown
## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| API Rate Limits | High | High | Implement caching, queue management |
| Webhook Delivery Failures | Medium | High | Retry logic, dead letter queue |
| Security Token Exposure | Low | Critical | Vault integration, rotation policy |
| Scalability Issues | Medium | Medium | Horizontal scaling ready |
| GitHub API Changes | Low | High | Version pinning, monitoring |
```

#### 4. **Initial Requirements List**
```markdown
## Validated Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. Automated PR validation on creation/update
2. Code quality checks (lint, format, test)
3. Security vulnerability scanning
4. Automated dependency updates
5. Custom workflow triggers
6. Team notification system

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Response time < 5 seconds
2. 99.9% uptime SLA
3. Support 1000 concurrent workflows
4. Full audit trail
5. GDPR compliance
6. Multi-repo support
```

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Architecture & Planning (STARTING)

### 📥 Using Research Inputs for Architecture

#### 1. **System Architecture Design**
Based on research findings, we design:

```markdown
## High-Level Architecture

### Components (from research recommendations):
1. **Webhook Receiver Service**
   - Technology: Express.js server
   - Purpose: Handle GitHub webhooks
   - Scaling: Horizontal (from risk assessment)

2. **Job Queue System**
   - Technology: Bull + Redis
   - Purpose: Process workflows asynchronously
   - Rationale: Handle API rate limits (from risks)

3. **Workflow Engine**
   - Technology: Node.js workers
   - Purpose: Execute automation logic
   - Design: Plugin-based (from requirements)

4. **Data Store**
   - Technology: PostgreSQL
   - Purpose: Store configs, history, metrics
   - Schema: JSONB for flexible workflows
```

#### 2. **API/Interface Definitions**
Derived from functional requirements:

```markdown
## API Design

### Webhook Endpoints (from requirements):
POST /webhooks/github
- Pull request events
- Push events
- Issue events
- Release events

### Management API:
GET /api/workflows
POST /api/workflows
PUT /api/workflows/:id
DELETE /api/workflows/:id

### Monitoring API (from non-functional reqs):
GET /api/health
GET /api/metrics
GET /api/audit-trail
```

#### 3. **Security Architecture**
Based on risk assessment:

```markdown
## Security Design

### Token Management (Critical Risk):
- HashiCorp Vault integration
- Automatic rotation every 30 days
- Encrypted at rest and in transit

### Webhook Validation:
- HMAC signature verification
- IP allowlisting
- Request replay protection
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Architecture Team

With these research inputs, the architecture team should:

1. **Create detailed component diagrams** using the recommended tech stack
2. **Design data models** based on the workflow requirements
3. **Plan API contracts** for all integration points
4. **Define deployment architecture** considering scaling needs
5. **Document security controls** for each identified risk

The architecture phase can now proceed with confidence, having all necessary inputs from research clearly documented and validated.
