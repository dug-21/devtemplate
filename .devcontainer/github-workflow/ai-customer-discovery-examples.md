# AI Customer Discovery: Practical Examples

## Example 1: B2B SaaS Startup - Project Management Tool

### Scenario
You're building a project management tool for remote teams.

### Traditional Approach (3 months)
- Recruit 30 potential customers
- Schedule 30-minute interviews
- Transcribe and analyze manually
- Cost: ~$15,000
- Time: 120+ hours

### AI-Powered Approach (2 weeks)
```python
# Using Synthetic Users API
synthetic_personas = [
    {"role": "Project Manager", "company_size": "50-200", "industry": "Tech"},
    {"role": "Team Lead", "company_size": "10-50", "industry": "Marketing"},
    {"role": "CEO", "company_size": "5-10", "industry": "Consulting"}
]

# Generate 100 interviews per persona
interviews = synthetic_users.bulk_interview(
    personas=synthetic_personas,
    questions=interview_questions,
    count_per_persona=100
)

# AI Analysis
insights = ai_analyzer.extract_patterns(interviews)
```

### Results
- 300 interviews completed in 24 hours
- Cost: $1,500
- Key insight: Remote teams need async communication features more than real-time
- Pivoted from live collaboration to async-first design

## Example 2: Consumer Mobile App - Fitness Tracker

### Using Genway for Continuous Discovery
```javascript
// Genway Configuration
const discoveryPipeline = {
    trigger: "new_user_signup",
    delay: "7_days",
    questions: [
        "What motivated you to download our app?",
        "What's your biggest fitness challenge?",
        "How do you track progress currently?"
    ],
    followUp: {
        condition: "mentioned_specific_goal",
        questions: ["Tell me more about your {goal}"]
    }
};

// Automated insights dashboard
genway.createDashboard({
    segments: ["age_group", "fitness_level", "goals"],
    metrics: ["satisfaction", "feature_requests", "churn_predictors"]
});
```

### Continuous Learning Loop
1. New users automatically interviewed after 1 week
2. AI identifies patterns in real-time
3. Product team receives weekly insight reports
4. Features prioritized based on data

## Example 3: E-commerce Platform - Sustainable Fashion

### Hybrid Approach with Canvas
```yaml
# Canvas AI Configuration
customer_success_ai:
  onboarding:
    - trigger: "first_purchase"
    - ai_interview: 
        mode: "conversational"
        topics: ["shopping_motivation", "sustainability_importance", "price_sensitivity"]
    
  retention:
    - trigger: "no_purchase_30_days"
    - ai_outreach:
        personalized: true
        discover: "purchase_barriers"
        offer: "contextual_solutions"

  insights:
    - frequency: "weekly"
    - segments: ["eco_conscious", "fashion_forward", "bargain_hunters"]
    - recommendations: "product_development"
```

### Discovered Insights
- Eco-conscious segment wants supply chain transparency
- Fashion-forward segment needs styling recommendations
- Bargain hunters convert with bundled offers

## Example 4: Enterprise Software - HR Platform

### Multi-Stage Discovery Process

#### Stage 1: Synthetic Validation
```python
# Define enterprise personas
personas = {
    "hr_director": {
        "company_size": "500-1000",
        "pain_points": ["compliance", "employee_engagement", "data_silos"],
        "budget_authority": True
    },
    "ceo": {
        "company_size": "100-500",
        "pain_points": ["talent_retention", "culture", "growth"],
        "budget_authority": True
    },
    "hr_manager": {
        "company_size": "50-200",
        "pain_points": ["daily_operations", "reporting", "automation"],
        "budget_authority": False
    }
}

# Test value propositions
value_props = [
    "All-in-one HR platform",
    "AI-powered employee insights",
    "Compliance automation suite",
    "Employee experience platform"
]

results = synthetic_users.test_value_props(personas, value_props)
# Winner: "AI-powered employee insights" (87% interest)
```

#### Stage 2: Real Customer Validation
```javascript
// Hyperbound Sales Discovery
const salesPlaybook = hyperbound.create({
    scenario: "HR platform demo",
    buyer_personas: ["hr_director", "ceo"],
    objections: [
        "We already have an HR system",
        "AI seems complex",
        "What about data privacy?"
    ],
    discovery_goals: [
        "Current system pain points",
        "Decision making process",
        "Success metrics"
    ]
});

// Train sales team with AI buyers
hyperbound.trainTeam(salesTeam, salesPlaybook, {
    sessions: 50,
    difficulty: "progressive"
});
```

## Example 5: Two-Sided Marketplace - Freelance Platform

### Dual-Sided Discovery
```python
# Freelancer Discovery
freelancer_ai = {
    "interview_triggers": [
        "profile_completion",
        "first_proposal_sent",
        "first_job_completed"
    ],
    "key_questions": {
        "profile": "What services are you most confident offering?",
        "proposal": "What challenges did you face finding suitable projects?",
        "completion": "How was your experience with the client?"
    }
}

# Client Discovery  
client_ai = {
    "interview_triggers": [
        "project_posted",
        "first_hire",
        "project_completed"
    ],
    "key_questions": {
        "posting": "What specific skills are you looking for?",
        "hiring": "How did you choose this freelancer?",
        "completion": "Did the outcome meet expectations?"
    }
}

# Cross-segment Analysis
marketplace_insights = ai.analyze_both_sides(
    freelancer_responses,
    client_responses,
    find_patterns=["mismatched_expectations", "pricing_gaps", "communication_issues"]
)
```

### Key Findings
- Clients want more vetting/certification
- Freelancers want clearer project scopes
- Both sides need better communication tools

## Example 6: Hardware Startup - Smart Home Device

### Pre-Manufacturing Validation
```javascript
// Before building expensive prototypes
const conceptTests = {
    products: [
        {
            name: "Smart Air Monitor",
            features: ["CO2", "humidity", "temperature", "alerts"],
            price_point: "$199"
        },
        {
            name: "Whole Home Air System",
            features: ["monitoring", "purification", "automation"],
            price_point: "$999"
        }
    ],
    
    synthetic_market_test: {
        segments: ["health_conscious", "tech_early_adopter", "parents", "allergy_sufferers"],
        sample_size: 1000,
        geography: ["urban", "suburban"]
    }
};

// Results guided physical prototype
const winningConcept = "Smart Air Monitor";
const mustHaveFeatures = ["real_time_app", "health_recommendations", "multiple_rooms"];
const acceptablePrice = "$149-179";
```

## Implementation Code Snippets

### Setting Up AI Interview Pipeline
```python
import ai_discovery_tools as adt

class CustomerDiscoveryPipeline:
    def __init__(self, startup_stage):
        self.stage = startup_stage
        self.tools = self._select_tools()
    
    def _select_tools(self):
        if self.stage == "idea":
            return ["synthetic_users"]
        elif self.stage == "mvp":
            return ["synthetic_users", "genway"]
        elif self.stage == "growth":
            return ["genway", "canvas", "hyperbound"]
    
    def run_discovery(self, hypothesis):
        results = {}
        
        # Synthetic validation
        if "synthetic_users" in self.tools:
            results['synthetic'] = self.validate_with_synthetic(hypothesis)
        
        # Real user interviews
        if "genway" in self.tools:
            results['real_users'] = self.interview_real_users(hypothesis)
        
        # Analyze and recommend
        return self.ai_analyze(results)
```

### Bias Detection Framework
```javascript
class BiasDetector {
    constructor() {
        this.checks = [
            this.checkLeadingQuestions,
            this.checkDemographicBalance,
            this.checkResponsePatterns,
            this.checkInterviewerEffect
        ];
    }
    
    analyze(interviews) {
        const biasReport = {
            overall_score: 0,
            issues: [],
            recommendations: []
        };
        
        this.checks.forEach(check => {
            const result = check(interviews);
            if (result.bias_detected) {
                biasReport.issues.push(result);
                biasReport.recommendations.push(result.fix);
            }
        });
        
        biasReport.overall_score = this.calculateScore(biasReport);
        return biasReport;
    }
}
```

// Auto-update roadmap based on discoveries
class AIRoadmapUpdater {
    async updatePriorities() {
        const insights = await aiDiscovery.getLatestInsights();
        const currentRoadmap = await productBoard.getRoadmap();
        
        const recommendations = this.ai.analyzePriorities({
            customer_insights: insights,
            current_roadmap: currentRoadmap,
            business_goals: this.goals
        });
        
        if (recommendations.confidence > 0.8) {
            await productBoard.suggestUpdates(recommendations);
            await this.notifyTeam(recommendations);
        }
    }
}
```
