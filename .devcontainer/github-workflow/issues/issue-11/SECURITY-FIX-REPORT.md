# Security Fix Report - Issue #11

## Critical Security Vulnerability Fixed

### Summary
Fixed a critical security vulnerability where GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) were being logged in plaintext to temporary MCP configuration files.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Type**: Credential Exposure
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Location**: `automation-enhanced.js` line 255
- **Impact**: GitHub tokens were written to `.temp/mcp-config-*.json` files

### Root Cause
The MCP configuration object included the AGENT_TOKEN in its environment variables, which was then serialized to JSON and saved to disk:

```javascript
env: {
    AGENT_TOKEN: this.config.github.token || process.env.AGENT_TOKEN
}
```

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Code Changes
- **Modified**: `automation-enhanced.js` - Removed token from MCP config
- **Added**: Security check module to prevent future occurrences
- **Added**: `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

#### 2. Security Measures
- Created `security-check.js` module that:
  - Detects sensitive patterns (tokens, secrets, passwords)
  - Prevents writing sensitive data to files
  - Provides sanitization methods
  - Includes CLI scanner for auditing

#### 3. Cleanup Actions
- Deleted all existing MCP config files containing tokens
- Verified no sensitive files in git history (for this branch)
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns

### Prevention Measures

1. **Automated Security Checks**
   - All file writes now pass through security validation
   - Sensitive data is automatically redacted
   - Security violations are logged

2. **Gitignore Patterns**
   ```
   .temp/
   mcp-config*.json
   .env*
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Usage**
   - Tokens are now passed only via environment variables
   - No credentials are written to configuration files

### Verification

Run security scan:
```bash
node issues/issue-11/security-check.js scan .
```

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **REVOKE** the exposed GitHub token immediately
   - Generate a new token with minimal required permissions
   - Update environment variables with new token

2. **Best Practices**
   - Always use environment variables for secrets
   - Never log or write tokens to files
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
   - Regular security audits using the scanner

### Files Modified
1. `/automation-enhanced.js` - Fixed token exposure
2. `/.gitignore` - Added security patterns
3. `/issues/issue-11/security-check.js` - Security validation module

### Testing
The security module can be tested:
```javascript
const SecurityCheck = require('./security-check');
const checker = new SecurityCheck();

// Will throw error if sensitive data detected
await checker.safeWriteFile('config.json', configData);
```
