# Issue #14 Fix Summary: Comment Detection

**Issue:** New comments (especially with @claude mentions) were not being picked up by the monitor.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Processed Comments File**: The `.processed-comments-v3.json` file was never initialized, causing the monitor to fail tracking which comments had been processed.

2. **Insufficient Buffer Time**: The 5-second buffer was too small, potentially missing comments due to timing issues.

3. **Lack of Logging**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to debug why comments were being missed.

## Implemented Fix

### 1. Initialize Processed Comments File
```javascript
// Added to initialize() method
try {
    await fs.access(this.processedCommentsFile);
} catch {
    await fs.writeFile(this.processedCommentsFile, '[]');
    await this.log('Created new processed comments file');
}
```

### 2. Increased Buffer Time
- Changed from 5 seconds to 30 seconds to ensure no comments are missed
- This accounts for any delays in GitHub API updates

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging for each comment being checked
- Shows whether comments are human, processed, contain @claude, etc.
- Logs the total number of comments found and processed

### 4. Improved Comment Detection Logic
- Better detection of human comments (excludes bot accounts)
- Clearer logic for when to process comments
- Always marks comments as processed to avoid duplicates

## Testing

1. Run the test script to verify current state:
   ```bash
   node issues/issue-14/test-comment-detection.js
   ```

2. Restart the monitor to apply the fix:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current monitor
   pkill -f "node monitor-enhanced.js"
   
   # Start it again
   node monitor-enhanced.js &
   ```

3. Run the verification script to create a test comment:
   ```bash
   node issues/issue-14/verify-fix.js
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. The monitor will create `.processed-comments-v3.json` on first run
2. All human comments on issues will be detected within 1 minute
3. @claude mentions will trigger detailed responses
4. Comments on completed issues will be handled as follow-ups
5. The monitor will maintain a persistent record of processed comments
