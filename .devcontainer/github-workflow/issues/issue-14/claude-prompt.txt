FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- **EXISTING CODE FILES**: Modify in their original locations (DO NOT copy to issue directory)
- **NEW ARTIFACTS ONLY**: Store these in the issue directory:
  - Implementation summaries (SUMMARY.md)
  - Research reports
  - Analysis documents
  - Test results
  - Other work products NOT part of the codebase
- Clean up temporary files after use
- Document all created files

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

1. INITIALIZATION:
   mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
     owner: "dug-21",
     repo: "devtemplate",
     issue_number: 14,
     body: "ðŸ”„ **Starting Implementation**\n\nInitializing file organization system..."
   })

2. During implementation:
   - EDIT existing code files in-place
   - CREATE new artifacts in issue directory
   - Post progress updates
   - Track all operations

3. COMPLETION:
   - Create summary report in issue directory
   - List both modified files and created artifacts
   - Clean up temporary files

Remember: NEVER copy existing code files to the issue directory. Always modify them in-place!
