Implement GitHub Workflow Automation System Redesign using TDD and SPARC methodology with the following 15 specialized agents working in parallel:

SPARC ANALYSIS PHASE:
1. SPARC Architect: Create SPARC specification (Situation, Problem, Alternatives, Recommendation, Conclusion) for the GitHub workflow automation redesign
2. Systems Designer: Design event-driven architecture components and interactions
3. Integration Architect: Define GitHub Actions, MCP, and ruv-swarm integration patterns

TEST SPECIFICATION PHASE (TDD):
4. Test Engineer: Write comprehensive test specifications before implementation
5. Quality Analyst: Define quality metrics and test coverage requirements

CORE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (Parallel Tracks):
Track 1 - GitHub Actions:
6. Actions Developer: Implement GitHub Actions workflows for event processing
7. DevOps Engineer: Setup GitHub Actions infrastructure and deployment

Track 2 - Core Engine:
8. Core Developer: Build issue processing engine and comment handling
9. Automation Developer: Implement EPIC phase transitions and template logic

Track 3 - AI Integration:
10. AI Integration Developer: Integrate Claude Code CLI and ruv-swarm coordination
11. Security Engineer: Implement Bot-PAT authentication and secure credentials

VALIDATION PHASE:
12. Requirements Analyst: Validate implementation against system requirements
13. Documentation Engineer: Create comprehensive documentation

COORDINATION:
14. Project Coordinator: Manage dependencies and track progress
15. Technical Reviewer: Review code and approve phase transitions

Key Requirements:
- Event-driven architecture using GitHub Actions
- Integration with existing ruv-swarm patterns from monitor-enhanced-fixed.js
- EPIC iterative refinement design with 8 phases
- Bot-PAT authentication
- Response time < 5 seconds
- File organization in .devcontainer/github-workflow/ structure

Deliverables:
1. SPARC specification document
2. Test specifications (TDD approach)
3. GitHub Actions workflows
4. Core processing engine
5. AI integration components
6. Security implementation
7. Complete documentation
8. Deployment scripts
