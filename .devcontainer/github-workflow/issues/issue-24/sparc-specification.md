# SPARC Specification: GitHub Workflow Automation System Redesign

## Situation
The current GitHub workflow automation system requires a complete redesign to leverage event-driven architecture, improve response times, and integrate seamlessly with AI agents through ruv-swarm. The existing system has proven the ruv-swarm and Claude integration works well, but the overall architecture needs modernization.

## Problem
- Current polling-based architecture causes delays and inefficiencies
- Complex state management requirements that may not be needed
- Lack of structured phase-based workflow management
- No clear separation between different types of automation triggers
- Missing comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Minimal Changes (Rejected)
- Keep polling architecture but optimize intervals
- Add basic phase management on top of existing system
- **Cons**: Doesn't address fundamental architectural issues, limited scalability

### Alternative 2: External Service Architecture (Rejected)
- Build separate microservice with webhooks
- Maintain state in external database
- **Cons**: Adds complexity, requires additional infrastructure, against KISS principle

### Alternative 3: Event-Driven GitHub Actions (Recommended)
- Leverage GitHub Actions for all event processing
- Use workflow dispatch and repository events
- Integrate with existing ruv-swarm patterns
- File-based state only when absolutely necessary

## Recommendation

Implement Alternative 3 with the following architecture:

### Core Components

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - `issue-created.yml`: Handles new issue events
   - `issue-comment.yml`: Processes comments and mentions
   - `workflow-dispatch.yml`: Manual triggers and reprocessing
   - `epic-phase-transition.yml`: Manages EPIC phase progression

2. **Event Processing Engine**
   - Lightweight Node.js handlers for each event type
   - Reuses patterns from `monitor-enhanced-fixed.js`
   - Direct integration with ruv-swarm for orchestration
   - Claude Code CLI for AI processing

3. **EPIC Phase Management**
   - 8-phase workflow (Inception â†’ Operations)
   - Living document approach in issue body
   - Phase-specific templates and AI prompts
   - Automatic sub-task generation

4. **Security & Authentication**
   - Bot-PAT for all automated actions
   - Secrets stored in GitHub Actions
   - Secure credential handling

### Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Test Specification (TDD)**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - End-to-end test scenarios

2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Event processing handlers
   - ruv-swarm integration layer

3. **Phase 3: Deployment**
   - GitHub Actions setup
   - Configuration management
   - Documentation

## Conclusion

This event-driven architecture using GitHub Actions provides:
- **Response time < 5 seconds** through webhook events
- **Simplified architecture** following KISS principle
- **Seamless integration** with existing ruv-swarm patterns
- **Comprehensive phase management** for complex workflows
- **Robust testing** through TDD approach

The redesign maintains what works (ruv-swarm/Claude integration) while modernizing the event processing and workflow management components.
