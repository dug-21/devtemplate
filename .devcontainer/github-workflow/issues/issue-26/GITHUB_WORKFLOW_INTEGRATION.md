```

### Automated Spiral Management

```yaml
# .github/workflows/spiral-management.yml
name: Spiral Development Manager
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * MON'  # Weekly spiral review
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  spiral-review:
    steps:
      - name: Analyze Current Spiral
        run: |
          # Check quadrant completion
          # Gather metrics from AI agents
          # Generate progress report
      
      - name: Plan Next Spiral
        run: |
          # Identify remaining risks

```

## 3. Conversation-Driven Development (CDD)

### Conversational Issue Management

```markdown
## CDD Issue Format

### Initial Prompt
> Let's build [feature]. I'm thinking about [initial ideas].

### AI Response Structure
```
ü§ñ **AI Development Assistant**

I understand you want to build [feature]. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Primary Use Case**: [question]
2. **Technical Constraints**: [question]
3. **Success Criteria**: [question]

Based on your initial ideas, I see these possibilities:
- Option A: [description]
- Option B: [description]
- Option C: [description]

Which direction interests you most?
```

### Conversation Threading
- Each major decision point creates a sub-thread
- AI agents maintain context across conversations
- Decisions are automatically documented
- Code sketches are generated inline
```

### Conversation Analysis Tools

```python
# tools/conversation_analyzer.py
class ConversationAnalyzer:
    def extract_requirements(self, conversation):
        """Extract requirements from conversation history"""
        requirements = []
        decisions = []
        constraints = []
        
        # AI-powered analysis of conversation
        # Returns structured data for development
        
    def generate_summary(self, conversation):
        """Create executive summary of conversation"""
        return {
            "key_decisions": decisions,
            "requirements": requirements,
            "action_items": actions,
            "next_steps": next_steps
        }
    
    def create_documentation(self, conversation):
        """Auto-generate docs from conversation"""
        # Produces README, API docs, etc.
```
