# Practical Examples: HDD in Action

## Example 1: Building an Auto-Save Feature

### Traditional Approach (What You Want to Avoid)
```
Week 1-2: Requirements gathering
Week 3-4: Technical design
Week 5-6: Implementation
Week 7: Testing
Week 8: Bug fixes
Week 9: Documentation
Week 10: Deployment

Total: 10 weeks, high risk of building wrong thing
```

### HDD Approach (Recommended)

#### Day 1-2: Discovery Phase
**Hypothesis**: "Users lose work due to crashes/forgetting to save. Auto-save every 30 seconds will reduce data loss by 95%."

**AI Agent Actions**:
```bash
# Research Agent
- Analyze crash reports for data loss incidents
- Research auto-save implementations in similar tools
- Identify technical constraints (file I/O performance)

# Output
- 73% of support tickets mention lost work
- Best practice: differential saves, not full file
- Performance impact: <50ms per save acceptable
```

**Exit Gate**: Hypothesis validated, approach selected

#### Day 3-5: Prototype Phase
**Build Three Approaches**:
1. Simple timer-based full save
2. Differential save with conflict detection
3. Background thread with async I/O

**AI Agent Actions**:
```javascript
// Builder Agent generates all three prototypes
// Each ~100 lines of code
// Basic but functional implementations
```

**Exit Gate**: Approach #2 selected based on performance tests

#### Day 6-7: Validation Phase
**Test Results**:
- Performance: 23ms average save time ✓
- Reliability: 0 data loss in 1000 crash simulations ✓
- UX: No user interruption detected ✓

**Exit Gate**: Success criteria met, ready for evolution

#### Day 8-10: Evolution Phase
**Improvements Based on Data**:
- Add visual indicator during saves
- Implement save history (last 10 versions)
- Add user preference for save frequency

**Total: 10 days, with validated solution**

## Example 2: API Rate Limiting System

### The Hypothesis Approach

#### Discovery Phase Hypothesis
"API abuse causes 60% of our downtime. Implementing intelligent rate limiting will reduce incidents by 80% while maintaining good UX for legitimate users."

#### Prototype Variations (Day 3-5)
```python
# Prototype A: Simple token bucket
class TokenBucketLimiter:
    # 50 lines of core logic
    # Pros: Simple, predictable
    # Cons: No user differentiation

# Prototype B: Sliding window with user tiers
class SlidingWindowLimiter:
    # 100 lines including tier logic
    # Pros: Flexible, fair
    # Cons: More complex

# Prototype C: AI-adaptive limiting
class AdaptiveLimiter:
    # 150 lines with ML scoring
    # Pros: Intelligent, self-tuning
    # Cons: Requires training data
```

#### Validation Results (Day 6-7)
| Metric | Prototype A | Prototype B | Prototype C |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Blocked legitimate users | 12% | 3% | 1% |
| Blocked malicious requests | 85% | 92% | 98% |
| CPU overhead | 0.1% | 0.3% | 2.1% |
| Implementation complexity | Low | Medium | High |

**Decision**: Start with Prototype B, plan C for future

## Example 3: Real-Time Collaboration Feature

### How HDD Prevents Common Pitfalls

#### Traditional Pitfall: Over-Engineering
```
❌ Spending 3 weeks building complex CRDT system
❌ Implementing every possible conflict resolution
❌ Creating elaborate presence indicators
❌ Building before validating need
```

#### HDD Prevention
```
✓ Day 1: Hypothesis: "Users need to see others' cursors"
✓ Day 3: Simple prototype with WebSockets
✓ Day 5: Test with 5 users
✓ Day 6: Learn: Users actually want change notifications, not cursors
✓ Day 7: Pivot to simpler solution
✓ Day 10: Ship what users actually need
```

## Comparison: Three Approaches Side-by-Side

### Feature: Authentication System

#### HDD Approach
```
Days 1-2: Hypothesis: "JWT with refresh tokens optimal"
Days 3-5: Prototype JWT, OAuth, and Magic Link
Days 6-7: Test security, UX, and performance
Days 8-10: Implement winner with optimizations
Result: Best solution based on data
```

#### SDAA Approach
```
Spiral 1 (Week 1): Explore auth options, evaluate risks
Spiral 2 (Week 2): Prototype highest-risk approach
Spiral 3 (Week 3): Address security concerns
Spiral 4 (Week 4): Production hardening
Result: Risk-minimized solution
```

#### CDD Approach
```
Day 1: Discuss auth needs interactively
Day 2-3: AI sketches based on conversation
Day 4-6: Build together with real-time adjustments
Day 7-8: Refine based on continuous feedback
Result: Exactly what was discussed
```

## AI Agent Task Examples

### Discovery Phase AI Prompts
```markdown
Research Agent: "Analyze our codebase for patterns where [feature] might integrate. Check for conflicts with existing systems."

Analyst Agent: "What are the top 3 technical risks for implementing [feature]? Provide mitigation strategies."

Architect Agent: "Generate 3 different architectural approaches for [feature], optimizing for different qualities (performance/simplicity/extensibility)."
```

### Prototype Phase AI Prompts
```markdown
Builder Agent: "Create a minimal but functional implementation of [approach]. Focus on core logic, skip error handling."

Test Agent: "Generate test cases that validate our hypothesis metrics. Include edge cases."

Optimizer Agent: "Analyze the prototype for performance bottlenecks. Suggest quick wins."
```

### Validation Phase AI Prompts
```markdown
QA Agent: "Run comprehensive tests including load, security, and integration. Report against hypothesis metrics."

Analyst Agent: "Interpret test results. Does the data support our hypothesis? What did we learn?"

Documentation Agent: "Create a decision record summarizing what we built, why, and what we learned."
```

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: "The feature is too big for 10 days"
**Solution**: Break into multiple hypotheses
```
Feature: E-commerce checkout
Hypothesis 1: Payment processing (10 days)
Hypothesis 2: Cart persistence (10 days)
Hypothesis 3: Order management (10 days)
Each validated independently, integrated incrementally
```

### Scenario 2: "Requirements are very unclear"
**Solution**: Discovery phase focuses on experiments
```
Day 1-2: Build 5 tiny prototypes exploring the space
Day 3: User feedback on all 5
Day 4: Form hypothesis based on feedback
Day 5-10: Standard HDD flow
```

### Scenario 3: "High-risk architectural change"
**Solution**: Combine HDD with SDAA principles
```
Hypothesis: "New architecture improves performance 10x"
Prototype: Build minimal version in isolated environment
Validation: Extensive testing including rollback procedures
Evolution: Gradual rollout with monitoring
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ "Hypothesis Shopping"
Starting with conclusion, finding hypothesis to match

### ❌ "Prototype Perfection"
Spending too much time on throwaway code

### ❌ "Validation Theater"
Testing things that don't relate to hypothesis

### ❌ "Evolution Creep"
Adding features without new hypotheses

## Success Patterns to Embrace

### ✓ "Fail Fast, Learn Faster"
Celebrate quick failures as learning wins

### ✓ "Data Over Opinions"
Let metrics drive decisions, not preferences

### ✓ "AI as Partner"
AI agents handle repetitive work, you handle creative decisions

### ✓ "Document by Doing"
Documentation generated from actual development, not separate effort
