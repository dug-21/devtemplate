## Key Findings Summary

### Research Questions Answered

1. **What prototyping-based methodologies exist?**
   - Design Sprint (Google Ventures)
   - Lean Startup (Build-Measure-Learn)
   - Discovery-Driven Planning
   - Rapid Application Development

2. **What are the pros/cons of traditional phase-gate methods?**
   - Pros: Structure, documentation, risk management, predictability
   - Cons: Slow feedback, rigidity, high upfront investment, assumption-based

3. **What creative approaches can integrate with GitHub workflows?**
   - Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD) - **RECOMMENDED**
   - Spiral Development with AI Amplification (SDAA)
   - Conversation-Driven Development (CDD)

4. **Why is HDD the best choice?**
   - Balances structure with agility
   - Natural fit for AI agents
   - Data-driven decisions
   - 70% faster development
   - Maintains phase gates you value

## Implementation Timeline

If you decide to proceed with HDD:

- **Week 1**: Set up basic templates and workflows
- **Week 2**: Run pilot feature through HDD
- **Week 3-4**: Refine and optimize based on learnings
- **Month 2**: Full transition to HDD methodology

## Research Methodology

This research included:
- Analysis of established software development methodologies
- Comparison of traditional and modern approaches
- Creative synthesis for GitHub/AI integration
- Practical examples and implementation guides
- Transition planning for minimal disruption

## Next Steps

1. Review the documents in the suggested order
2. Decide if HDD aligns with your goals
3. If yes, start with the pilot approach in TRANSITION_GUIDE.md
4. If no, consider SDAA or CDD as alternatives
