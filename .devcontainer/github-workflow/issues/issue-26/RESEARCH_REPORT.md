## Traditional Phase-Gate Methods Analysis

### Overview
Traditional phase-gate (Stage-GateÂ®) methods follow a linear progression through distinct phases with formal review gates between each phase.

### Benefits
- **Risk Reduction**: Each gate ensures thorough review before proceeding
- **Clear Accountability**: Defined deliverables and approval processes
- **Resource Management**: Prevents waste by stopping projects early if needed
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive paper trail for decisions
- **Predictability**: Easier to estimate timelines and costs

### Disadvantages
- **Slow Feedback Loops**: Learning happens late in the process
- **Rigidity**: Difficult to adapt to changing requirements
- **Innovation Stifling**: Linear thinking can limit creative solutions
- **High Upfront Investment**: Significant planning before any tangible output
- **Assumption Risk**: Early decisions based on untested assumptions

- User Design (prototyping)
- Construction
- Cutover

**Strengths**:
- User involvement throughout
- Quick iterations
- Flexible to changes
- Reduced development time

**Integration Potential**: Good - Well-suited for AI-assisted development
