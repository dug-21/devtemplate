You are working on GitHub issue #26 with ENHANCED V3 file organization.

CRITICAL FILE MANAGEMENT RULES:
1. **MODIFY CODE FILES IN-PLACE** - Use Edit/MultiEdit tools for existing project files
2. **ONLY store NEW ARTIFACTS in issue directory** - Reports, summaries, research docs
3. Track all file operations for cleanup
4. Provide frequent progress updates
5. Create comprehensive documentation

Issue Details:
- Repository: dug-21/devtemplate
- Issue #26: Workflow methodology for idea to implementation
- Description: ### Research Topic

New product development methodologies

### Research Questions

Overall Goal:  Now that we have issue integration with our swarm system, I want to create a structured workflow methodology for implementing large complex features or systems.  we've researched this before, and came up with something like what I've included in background context: 

it is a fairly traditional approach to software development that enforces a phase gate structure for graduation to the next phase.  My intent was to create a helper to me, while I develop new projects, that would help drive better results when leveraging AI based development team.

Pros of this workflow idea:
- Structured entry/exit criteria - I like something that will guide me to be more specific for an AI Agent to work on
- This was going to use an [EPIC] approach, and file structure to keep all of the documentation up to date and organized as the feature evolved through its life cycle (I have more details on this part if needed)

Things I don't like about this model:
- the actual workflow feels very 1990ish.  Somewhat a traditional view of how to develop and evolve a feature.  - - While there is value in really determining requirements, i think I would work better with a 'hands-on' prototyping approach to delivery.

Your goal, is to research styles of advancing development of an idea.  There are still stages to this.. but maybe prototyping is one of them.  Its not first, there is still discovery/research/discussion about the idea.  but there's also the ability to rapidly prototype, which will drive better feedback... and having a workflow/system to enable that to happen would be fantastic.

Key Requirements that I'm currently thinking:
- Github issue based workflow that would guide large product/feature development for a personal development tool
- Still retain phase gates and require me the user to provide the AI based Agent delivery team to move through from vague thought to production implementation.
- File/structure management, ultimately maintaining the current feature information so that AI agents have access to the most recent decisions, also instructions for commit/push strategy, Decision records, etc.
-  development, 

The ask: Research current product development methods that enable more of the use of prototyping.  Consider the benefits of traditional methods, and bring these 2 types of systems together, and document how that might work.  DO NOT DEVELOP THIS SYSTEM.  THIS IS RESEARCH ONLY.

### Success Criteria

- 3-4 different strategies for product/feature development that lean toward leveraging prototyping
- Bettern understand the traditional methods and the benefits of phase gate advancement of the feature, and also the disadvantages
- Be creative.  Come up with 3 approaches to integrate into our github workflow system: explain how each one might work
- Make 1 recommendation and explain why

Remember, this is a personal development tool.  I'm looking for a structured approach, but it does not have to be enterprise ready.

### Timeline

_No response_
- Labels: in-progress, swarm-active

FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- **EXISTING CODE FILES**: Modify in their original locations (DO NOT copy to issue directory)
- **NEW ARTIFACTS ONLY**: Store these in the issue directory:
  - Implementation summaries (SUMMARY.md)
  - Research reports
  - Analysis documents
  - Test results
  - Other work products NOT part of the codebase
- Clean up temporary files after use
- Document all created files

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

1. INITIALIZATION:
   mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
     owner: "dug-21",
     repo: "devtemplate",
     issue_number: 26,
     body: "🔄 **Starting Implementation**\n\nInitializing file organization system..."
   })

2. During implementation:
   - EDIT existing code files in-place
   - CREATE new artifacts in issue directory
   - Post progress updates
   - Track all operations

3. COMPLETION:
   - Create summary report in issue directory
   - List both modified files and created artifacts
   - Clean up temporary files

Remember: NEVER copy existing code files to the issue directory. Always modify them in-place!
