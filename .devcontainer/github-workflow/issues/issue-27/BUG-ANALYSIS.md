# Bug Analysis: Bot Responding to Own Comments

## Issue Summary
The bot is:
1. Responding to its own comments
2. Reprocessing the same comments on restart

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Bot Self-Check
The `checkForNewComments()` method doesn't check if the comment is from the authenticated bot itself. While it has a `getBotUsername()` method, it's never used to filter comments.

### 2. Incomplete Bot Detection
Current bot detection logic (lines 433-439):
- Checks for generic bot patterns: `user.type === 'Bot'`, `[bot]` in username
- Checks for AI signatures in comment body
- BUT doesn't check if `comment.user.login === this.botUsername`

### 3. Persistent Comment Processing Issue
The processed comments are saved to `.processed-comments-v3.json`, but on restart:
- The bot may load comments that were posted after the last check time
- The 30-second buffer (line 408) may cause re-checking of recent comments
- If a bot comment doesn't match the detection patterns, it gets reprocessed

## Code Flow Analysis

1. **checkForNewComments()** gets comments since last check time minus 30 seconds
2. For each comment:
   - Checks if already in `processedComments` set
   - Checks if it's a bot (but misses self-check)
   - Checks for AI signatures
   - If human + certain conditions â†’ processes comment
3. Bot's own comments may not match the AI signature patterns if they're error messages or status updates

## Fix Strategy

1. **Add self-check**: Compare `comment.user.login` with `this.botUsername`
2. **Initialize bot username early**: Call `getBotUsername()` during initialization
3. **Improve persistence**: Ensure all bot comments are marked as processed
4. **Add more comprehensive bot signatures**: Cover all types of bot responses
