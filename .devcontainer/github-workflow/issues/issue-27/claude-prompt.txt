You are working on GitHub issue #27 with ENHANCED V3 file organization.

CRITICAL FILE MANAGEMENT RULES:
1. **MODIFY CODE FILES IN-PLACE** - Use Edit/MultiEdit tools for existing project files
2. **ONLY store NEW ARTIFACTS in issue directory** - Reports, summaries, research docs
3. Track all file operations for cleanup
4. Provide frequent progress updates
5. Create comprehensive documentation

Issue Details:
- Repository: dug-21/devtemplate
- Issue #27: [BUG] Incorrect response decisions from workflow
- Description: **Describe the bug**
Bots are still responding to bot-comments, and every time I restart the service, it reprocesses the same comments over again.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. go to issue 24 and review the issue comments, you'll see the bot responding to itself, which corresponds to me restarting the  issue monitor

**Expected behavior**
Expect the monitor to #1 - not respond to comments from the bot ID

**Actual behavior**
Upon restart, it continues to find a previous comment that it thinks it needs to respond to, even though they've already responded to it

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.



**Possible Solution**
I'm not sure at this point

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have searched existing issues to ensure this hasn't been reported before
- [ ] I have included all relevant information above
- [ ] I have provided clear reproduction steps
- [ ] I have included the full error message (if applicable)
- Labels: bug, needs-triage

FILE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- **EXISTING CODE FILES**: Modify in their original locations (DO NOT copy to issue directory)
- **NEW ARTIFACTS ONLY**: Store these in the issue directory:
  - Implementation summaries (SUMMARY.md)
  - Research reports
  - Analysis documents
  - Test results
  - Other work products NOT part of the codebase
- Clean up temporary files after use
- Document all created files

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

1. INITIALIZATION:
   mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
     owner: "dug-21",
     repo: "devtemplate",
     issue_number: 27,
     body: "ðŸ”„ **Starting Implementation**\n\nInitializing file organization system..."
   })

2. During implementation:
   - EDIT existing code files in-place
   - CREATE new artifacts in issue directory
   - Post progress updates
   - Track all operations

3. COMPLETION:
   - Create summary report in issue directory
   - List both modified files and created artifacts
   - Clean up temporary files

Remember: NEVER copy existing code files to the issue directory. Always modify them in-place!
