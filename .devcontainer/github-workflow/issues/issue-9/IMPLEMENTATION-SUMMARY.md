# Issue #9 Implementation Summary

## Problem
The ruv-swarm MCP server disconnects from Claude after 1-2 uses or ~3 minutes of inactivity, causing the github-workflow system to stop responding.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. MCP Server Monitor Module (`mcp-server-monitor.js`)
A dedicated monitoring service that:
- Performs health checks every 30 seconds
- Detects disconnections automatically
- Implements auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Maintains connection metrics and logs
- Emits events for connection state changes

### 2. Enhanced Monitor Integration (`monitor-enhanced-v3-mcp.js`)
Extended the existing monitor to:
- Include MCP server monitoring alongside GitHub monitoring
- Create GitHub issues for critical MCP failures
- Track MCP health status
- Provide additional logging and metrics

### 3. Startup Script (`start-monitor-with-mcp.sh`)
A user-friendly startup script that:
- Ensures clean environment setup
- Sets required environment variables
- Handles process cleanup
- Provides clear logging

### 4. Test Suite (`test-mcp-monitor.js`)
Comprehensive tests for:
- Health check functionality
- Connection detection
- Disconnection handling
- Auto-reconnection
- Metrics collection

### 5. Documentation (`MCP-MONITOR-DOCUMENTATION.md`)
Complete documentation covering:
- Architecture and components
- Configuration options
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Integration details

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Detects and recovers from MCP server disconnections
2. **Configurable Retries**: Up to 5 reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring
4. **GitHub Integration**: Creates issues for critical failures requiring manual intervention
5. **Event-Driven**: Uses events for clean integration with other components

```

## Usage

To start the enhanced monitor with MCP monitoring:

```bash
cd /workspaces/devtemplate/.devcontainer/github-workflow/issues/issue-9
./start-monitor-with-mcp.sh
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
node test-mcp-monitor.js
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Automatic recovery from MCP disconnections
2. **Reduced Downtime**: Quick detection and reconnection (typically < 1 minute)
3. **Better Visibility**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
4. **Proactive Alerting**: GitHub issues for critical failures
5. **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for existing monitor

## Next Steps

1. Deploy and monitor in production environment
2. Adjust health check intervals based on actual usage patterns
3. Consider implementing connection pooling for even better reliability
4. Add metrics dashboard for visual monitoring

This implementation provides a robust solution to the MCP server disconnection issue while maintaining compatibility with the existing github-workflow system.
