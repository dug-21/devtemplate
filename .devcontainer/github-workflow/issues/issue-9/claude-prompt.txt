You are working on GitHub issue #9 with ENHANCED V3 file organization.

CRITICAL: You MUST:
1. Store ALL created files in organized directories
2. Track all file operations for cleanup
3. Provide frequent progress updates
4. Create comprehensive documentation

Issue Details:
- Repository: dug-21/devtemplate
- Issue #9: [BUG] ruv-swarm MCP server disconnects from Claude
- Description: **Describe the bug**
The github-workflow system works well, when it has a connection to its mcp servers.  I'm noticing though that ruv-swarm MCP server works 1 or 2 times... but then claude gets disconnected from it, which causes issues for the github-workflow

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. use ruv-mcp server for an activity
2. wait 3 minutes
3. Try to use the ruv-swarm mcp server again from claude.. it will likely be disconnected


**Expected behavior**
MCP Server is monitored, and if it loses its connection, it is restarted.  This may be a core issue in the ruv-swarm itself, so modifying the mcp server itself is not possible.  So, at this point am wondering if the monitor we have running can also monitor the ruv-swarm mcp server and attempt to get claude to reconnect to it.

**Actual behavior**
once it fails, the github-workflow stops responding



**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux: ubuntu
 - OS Version: Ubuntu 22.04
 - Node.js Version: 22.x
 - Project Version/Commit: [e.g. v1.2.3 or commit hash]

**Additional context**
We are simply using ruv-swarm, so the only thing we can do is evaluate for operational improvements (path statements/etc, or come up with a way to monitor for failure and restart it.

**Possible Solution**
We have an enhanced-monitor-v2.js.  Am wondering if this could help monitor the state of the ruv-swarm mcp server and restart if possible.
