## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Team resistance | Medium | High | Gradual rollout, training, success stories |
| Tool complexity | Low | Medium | Simplified interfaces, good documentation |
| Process confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear guides, mentoring, examples |
| Performance impact | Low | Low | Optimization, caching, monitoring |
| Rollback needed | Low | High | Hybrid mode, feature flags, data preservation |

### Rollback Procedures

```javascript
// Emergency rollback procedure
async function rollbackToTraditional() {
  // 1. Disable HDD mode
  await updateConfig({ 
    hdd: { enabled: false },
    workflow: { mode: 'traditional' }
  });
  
  // 2. Preserve HDD data
  await backupHDDData({
    hypotheses: true,
    prototypes: true,
    learnings: true
  });
  
  // 3. Restore traditional workflows
  await restoreTraditionalTemplates();
  await reactivatePhaseGates();
  
  // 4. Notify team
  await notifyTeam({
    message: 'Reverting to traditional workflow',
    reason: getRollbackReason(),
    dataPreserved: true
  });
}
```
