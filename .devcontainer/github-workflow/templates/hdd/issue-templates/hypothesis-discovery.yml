        ## ðŸ”¬ Hypothesis-Driven Development - Discovery Phase
        
        This template helps you formulate a clear hypothesis for your feature idea.
        The hypothesis should be specific, measurable, and testable.

      label: Hypothesis Statement
      description: State your hypothesis in the format "I believe that [feature] will [outcome] as measured by [metric]"
      placeholder: |
        I believe that implementing [specific feature/change]
        will result in [expected outcome/benefit]
        as measured by [specific metric(s)]
        
        Example: "I believe that adding a dark mode toggle will improve user satisfaction 
        as measured by a 20% reduction in eye strain complaints and 15% increase in session duration"
